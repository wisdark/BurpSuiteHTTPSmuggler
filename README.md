# Burp Suite HTTP Smuggler
A Burp Suite extension to help pentesters to bypass WAFs or test their effectiveness using a number of techniques. 
This extension has been developed by Soroush Dalili (@irsdl) from NCC Group.

The initial release (v0.1) only supports the Encoding capability that can be quite complicated to be performed manually. 
See the references for more details.

Next versions will include more techniques and possible bug fixes.
